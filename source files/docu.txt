Stuff to keep in mind when wiriting the paper:

1. Template taken from Skosmos; enriched with some concepts (skos:definiton, skos:changeNote)
2. Hierarchy somewhat unclear A is parent of both A1 and AA


""" Data structure of OWC Text entries:
    1. Code is both hierarchical and identifier; so use as uri
    2. Bezeichnung is both preflabel and definition
    3. K indicates changes to OWC standard, perhaps as altlabel oder hiddenlabel """

            #elif entry.count(".") == 1 and code in ["OJ" + str(n) for n in range(6)]:
            #    narrower.append({"uri": make_uri(entry)})

        for thing in narrower:
            print(thing.values())
